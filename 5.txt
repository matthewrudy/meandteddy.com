that a deadline is fast approaching. Once again Id like to tell you that you really ought to consider submitting a film to the Ann Arbor film fest: go to it http://www.aafilmfest.org/submissions-enter.htm<br />
<br />
on a more appreciative note the photo of your grandma + mom is AMAZING- (secretly I’m completely jealous of your composition)  <br />
<br />
let me know if it the film thing pans out.<br />
<br />
see you someday,<br />

Luckily I am now back looking after this site.<br />
For a while it seems that some Spam-bots had got hold of this guestbook.<br />
They were messing it about,<br />
posting stuff about Viagra and such.<br />
So I've added a semi-clever new human-checker to the guestbook.<br />
Have a go, it's quite fun.<br><br><i style="font-size:12px">Added: 28th of April 06</i></div>
