<div class="heading"><strong>I want a goddamn guitar// </strong>| 5th January 2005</div>

As usual I don't spend any money except on large, long-term items which I become obsessed with. See my SLR, stereo, video camera and headphones for examples of this.<br>
Now, I've spent the last few weeks lusting after a nice guitar, namely the Yamaha APX9c (£500). The problem is that today, when I went and saw one in black cherry, I wasn't impressed.
But, I need a guitar.<br>
What do I do? Buy a cheap real acoustic (rather than electro), but undoubtedly not in a nice colour? Or buy a cheaper model in a colour I can love (ie. the £400 APX-7A in translucent green, or oriental blue)<br>
<br>
I just dunnae!!</div>

<br>
For the first time in my recent life I feared for my survival, I feared for the survival of MEANDTEDDY.com. It had expired, I hadn't got the email, I hadn't renewed it, it was forwarding to some random search engine.<br>
<br>
But now, my loyal friends, it is all back.<br>
<br>
So, what have I been doing all this time?<br>
Simple, <strong>nothing</strong>.<br>

I have been doing nothing except watching films and sleeping for long hours. It was my birthday yesterday (well, 2 days ago technically) and I did nothing except watch Zoolander, AI and Following. (I would have watched the Incredibles except I was tired and everyone hates me.)

Today was Dad's birthday. I watched most of "My Little Eye" but got bored by the end, so fastforwarded to the end. It was alright, I just don't see the point in making a film on video. But I'm just an arrogant snob.<br>
<br>
In any case, I may keep this updated.<br>
<br>
I'm currently awake at 2am because I'm writing this and thinking about my film for next term "Buscemi's Baby". <br>
I've written a page of synopsis, which isn't enough really. But I'm very slow.<br>
<br>
Alice has already agreed to play Buscemi's moustached, mute, bodyguard/butler Pedolino, but I still need to fill Buscemi himself, the obsessive guitar-playing fan Neeraj, and some random woman.
