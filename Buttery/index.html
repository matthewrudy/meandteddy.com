Since my first recorded musical work <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~jb420/music/Julian.mp3">"the Julian song"</a> hit the internet, it's been nearly impossible to do anything without being bombarded by phonecalls, emails, text messages and a pigeonhole full of record offers.<br>

<br>
That's fine, I don't mind being hunted by the record industry, my only problem is my current artistic/musical block. I've been singing the most I've ever sung in my life, but it's all rubbish.<br>
<br>
I just don't know what to do. <br>
Everything I do at the moment is rubbish! <br>
<br>

<a href="http://www.galleryariana.com/pages/theartist/theartist.htm"><img src="http://www.galleryariana.com/images/arianapics/headshotAriana.jpg" align=right>Ariana Richards (of Jurassic Park fame) is now an artist<br></a>
<strong>PROPER EXCITING!!!</strong>
<br>
And her work sells within the $600 - $6000 price range, so 'nuff likely I could buy some.<br>

<strong>WICKED!!!</strong><br>
<br>
Look out for a rigourised set of rules for table football, I've been meaning to do this for ages.<br />

<br>
For the first time in my recent life I feared for my survival, I feared for the survival of MEANDTEDDY.com. It had expired, I hadn't got the email, I hadn't renewed it, it was forwarding to some random search engine.<br>

<br>
But now, my loyal friends, it is all back.<br>
<br>
So, what have I been doing all this time?<br>
Simple, <strong>nothing</strong>.<br>

I have been doing nothing except watching films and sleeping for long hours. It was my birthday yesterday (well, 2 days ago technically) and I did nothing except watch Zoolander, AI and Following. (I would have watched the Incredibles except I was tired and everyone hates me.)<br />

Today was Dad's birthday. I watched most of "My Little Eye" but got bored by the end, so fastforwarded to the end. It was alright, I just don't see the point in making a film on video. But I'm just an arrogant snob.<br>
<br>
In any case, I may keep this updated.<br>
<br>
I'm currently awake at 2am because I'm writing this and thinking about my film for next term "Buscemi's Baby". <br>

I've written a page of synopsis, which isn't enough really. But I'm very slow.<br>
<br>
Alice has already agreed to play Buscemi's moustached, mute, bodyguard/butler Pedolino, but I still need to fill Buscemi himself, the obsessive guitar-playing fan Neeraj, and some random woman.<br />
