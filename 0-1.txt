<div class="heading"><strong>Musical frustrations</strong> | 31st October 2004</div>

<div class="entry">

Since my first recorded musical work <a href="http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~jb420/music/Julian.mp3">"the Julian song"</a> hit the internet, it's been nearly impossible to do anything without being bombarded by phonecalls, emails, text messages and a pigeonhole full of record offers.<br>
<br>
That's fine, I don't mind being hunted by the record industry, my only problem is my current artistic/musical block. I've been singing the most I've ever sung in my life, but it's all rubbish.<br>
<br>
I just don't know what to do. <br>
Everything I do at the moment is rubbish! <br>
<br>

<a href="http://www.galleryariana.com/pages/theartist/theartist.htm"><img src="http://www.galleryariana.com/images/arianapics/headshotAriana.jpg" align=right>Ariana Richards (of Jurassic Park fame) is now an artist<br></a>
<strong>PROPER EXCITING!!!</strong>
<br>
And her work sells within the $600 - $6000 price range, so 'nuff likely I could buy some.<br>
<strong>WICKED!!!</strong><br>
<br>
Look out for a rigourised set of rules for table football, I've been meaning to do this for ages.</div>






<div class="heading"><strong>Yeah, I feel fat. What you gonna do about it?</strong> | 20th October 2004</div>

<div class="entry">
<img src="http://lisag.com/photos/december/fat%20joe_sm.jpg" align=left>

Man, it's been a long time.<br>
Basically I have massive problems motivating myself at the moment. I need to find two beds, write news reports for Macbeth, get some more A3 for the photocopier, go to lectures, do some work, not eat at buttery, watch Neighbours...<br>
Proper hard, y'all!<br>
In any case, I feel fat and unfit (emphasised by the difficulty with which I carried a duvet from Mem to the Colony today.)<br>
Also, I just want to sing The Carpenters' "Close To You"!

<div class="heading"><strong>Cannibals!!</strong> | 11th October 2004</div>

<div class="entry">
<img src="http://www.uvm.edu/~sgutman/poe.jpg" align=left>"It's only a matter of time.<br>
When the Cannibals attack, I want you to kill me!" cries the woman.<br>
<i>Man slaps woman</i><br>
"I don't want to hear you say that again!"<br>
<i>They kiss!</i><br>
<br>
Such is the world of 70s Italian Cannibal Exploitation Flick "Eaten Alive". Described to Richard McDowell and myself as being very similar to the work of Edgar Allen Poe - but put to cheesey funk and a non-sensical plot - it's not as good as Cannibal Ferox.......but what is?<br>
<br>
In any case, crazy-film-geek man who works at Borders in Cambridge is, indeed, a freak!<br>
<img src="http://www.nbj.co.jp/newline/images/video/elc/2.jpg" align=right>The message, as with all films of Umberto Lenzi, is poignant.<br>
<strong>"public opinion just can't handle" the truth about Cannibals! VS "the whole world has to know, the stone age still exists"</strong><br>
Personally, I don't find cannibalism to be such a stretch of decency, nor do I think it's something that should be used to maintain racial stereotypes in the way the 70s Italian films I watch do.<br>The Vikings raped and pillaged their enemies, why is it so nonsensical to suggest they eat them afterwards?

<div class="heading"><strong>Mr South in a Castle</strong> | 9th October 2004</div>

<div class="entry">
<img src="http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk/images/front/punt-and-bridge.jpg" align=right><strong>So, who is Mr South?</strong><br>
He was my history teacher through GCSE and A Level<br>
<br>
<strong>Why should you care?</strong><br>
You shouldn't. It was just a silly dream<br>
<br>
In any case. In my dream I was around Julian's house somewhere in <a href="http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk">Clare</a> when I saw Mr South being taken on a guided tour by an estate agent.<br>
It turned out he was trying to buy Julian's house (in college)<br>
<br>
I don't (and didn't at the time) understand how he was buying a house from Clare at a time when Clare is looking to expand it's property base (and when Julian was living in the house) but it was happening.<br>
<br>
Seemingly Julian lived in a turret and, when questioned, Mr South revealed why he'd disappeared from Beaumont...for some reason he had to go into hiding. I don't know why.<br>
<br>
In any case, there was either a fire or a fire scare, and it reminded me of my fear of burning alive.<br>
<i>I am aware that most people die of smoke inhalation before they burn, but not the guy in Last Of The Mohicans!!!</i>

<i>Disclaimer: if Jimmy B wishes for me to remove his image from this site, please email me</i><br>
<br>
If Jimmy B doesn't care, as Julian David Parker asserts, then just enjoy the animated gif avatars I made for him, Alice and myself.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/misc/alice-forum.gif" align=right>My current issue (apart from being bored and entering a term of work like I have never imagined) is the Jimmy B "Photo Scandal"<br>
<br>
Apparently it's scandalous that I emailed an admin on the <a href="http://ucs.clare.cam.ac.uk">UCS Web Site</a> asking for an unflattering photo of myself to be removed.<br>
<br>
It was removed <img src="images/misc/me-pie.gif" align=left>(or, rather, cropped to remove myself) and so I no longer have an issue. But, given the person I emailed about it was ME, it's apparently scandalous.<br>
<br>
Apart from that, I'm alright, generally bored, but I've found the UCS Camp Bed I never got paid for and am about to start lectures...YAY!!!

<div class="heading"><strong>I don't understand</strong> | 3rd October 2004</div>

<div class="entry">
<i>Note: whenever I write the date, it's usually after midnight...but it seems silly to classify it as tomorrow because it's not</i><br>
<br>
Yeah, I don't understand.<br>
I think I'm just spaced out from exhaustion, lack of sleep, and a lingering hangover that I had to forget about this morning (so I could go and look after all the freshers)<br>
<br>
I also hate myself for being such a coward and, especially, for trying to trick myself and others that it's all just cool, elusive disinterest.<br>
I also sometimes trick myself inside my head that it's because I'm a mathmo and it's acceptable, expected, and justified. (i'm using commas in lists before the "and" because I believe it's right...I think it is, else it should be)<br>
That just isn't fair on all the great mathmos out there.<br>
<br>
I also spend a good deal of time assuring myself that I do indeed have some exciting artistic/genial* legacy to leave, but I don't. Or, at least, I'm unable to realise it at this time.<br>
<i>note: just because I work this year will not mean I will be senior wrangler, it is the most appaling excuse ever "I've never really worked before". Why not?</i><br>
<br>
Wasn't that self-aware in an original, disaffected youth type way?
<br>
<strong>NO!!! IT'S PROPER CLICHé</strong> (but should that matter?)<br>
<i>"Stop seeking the 'cool' and the 'cool' won't care anyway...but neither will you" - Me, just now</i><br>
<br>
<i>* don't even tell me "genial isn't normally used as 'of or relating to genii'" - I don't care</i>

<a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk"><div class="heading"><strong>Maths-ing it up</strong> | 28th September 2004</div></a>

<div class="entry">
<a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/"><img src="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/trinity.jpg" align=left></a>
So I'm back in the Cam, in my new room (I'll get a pic, show you it). Been working out my lecture timetable, but you ain't interested in that???<br>
<a href="images/misc/part2.xls">click here if you're cool</a><br>
<br>
So, I thought I'd talk about all the mathmos that kick it down proper wicked maths style.<br>
<br>
Firstly there's <a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~gpp24/">Gabriel Paternain</a> (see left). He's so cool because he gets to lecture Analysis II.<br>
Secondly there's <a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~jw291/">Julia Wolf</a> (see right). She's so cool because she gets to supervise Analysis II (and she went to Clare, and came to our Maths Dinner)<a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~jw291/"><img src="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/site2002/Photos/People/wolf_j.jpg" align=right></a><br>
<br>
Effectively, I'm not dissing all the other mathmos in the world, I'm just saying analysis is cool.<br>
<br>
As <a href="http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/site2002/People/korner_tw.html">Korner</a> says;<br>

<i>"Functional analysis goes hand in hand with measure theory. Towards the
end of the course I will need to refer Borel measures on the line. However,
I will not use any theorems from measure theory proper and I will make my
treatment independent of previous knowledge. Elsewhere I may make a few
remarks involving measure theory. These are for interest only and will not
be examinable1. I intend the course to be fully accessible without measure
theory."</i><br>
<br>
I'm so doing measure theory!

<div class="heading"><strong>Watermelon makes me wee</strong> | 27th September 2004</div>

<div class="entry"><img src="images/misc/rabbitwatermelon1.jpg" align=left>So, I ain't quite sorted my Photos yet. But I've got a php that will do it, I just need to stick all my stuff in appropriate directories, add descriptions, and it'll magic the interface up from nowt, like.<br>

I been eating watermelon, and it makes me wee. Normally I don't ever wee, but when I've been eating watermelon, I do wee. <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/poses/news_libby_0024.gif" align=right>Wee like the wee-iest wee-er in the whole of Weewee Garden City<br>
<br>
Apart from weeing, I've been thinking (spurred on by local Kym Valentine-lookalike appearing at the Horn yesterday - singing with fat, bald man that runs the Blue Angel Acoustic Café) <i>"What is life going to be like with out a daily fix of some Libby action?"</i><br>
<br>
Frankly, it's too difficult to comprehend. But, I guess, one day it's going to have to be confronted.<br>
<br>
Farewell to she that made journalistic ambition viable for all, took the fight for the rights of pregnant women and single mothers to the forefront of afternoon television plotlines, and told the other half of the story in regards to paedophilia and the abuse of the student-teacher relationship.

<div class="heading"><strong>Yeah, I ain't gonna do this</strong> | 25th September 2004</div>

<div class="entry">...every day. I don't care about having an online journal, and every thing I have to say is rather boring anyway. I just want to do the photo and film section as good as possible, host the odd thing I want to link, keep some news, maybe keep up the neighbours diary (but given I'll be in Cambridge for the next 9-ish weeks, I probably won't get to see it), but generally spend my life doing stuff rather than writing about stuff in an uninspired way</div>

<br>
Today started off being all about Ash and how she's really good at art - her art teacher was an inspiration to her<br>
It then kicked into gear, showing numerous exciting shots of bowling action going down.<br>
Yeah, Ash was rubbish, she was doing a double handed underarm swingy thing, which weren't no good, but she's a girl.<br>
<br>
<i>We lost a point in a quiz on tuesday because no one properly explained how bowling scores worked. So a strike refers to the next two balls, not the entire next frame (as opposed to the first ball of the next frame for a spare)...hence the maximum score is 300 not 210</i><br>
<br>
Right then, at the bowling alley, Ash's mum walks in - she's with a man, it's the art teacher!!!<br>
<br>
Anyway, Ash gets upset and has a dream which inspires her to make her art piece - a performance piece, two pins, one her mum, the other her teacher, and a bowling ball which she proceeds to roll toward the two pins.<br>

What I never knew (after watching two episodes before this one) is that not only did her parents get divorced, but her dad died!!!!

<i>"Why doesn't the government tax losses"</i>... <br>

it seems unfair to only tax profits...<br>
<br>
given Matthew Jacobs Ltd only exist for two days...<br>
31st March 2004, Matthew Jacobs Ltd invests £40000 in equipment...<br>
1st April 2004, Matthew Jacobs Ltd makes a sale worth £40000.<br>
<br>
If that had occured in the same tax year there'd be £40000 income, £40000 deduction = £0 profit...no tax for Matthew Jacobs Ltd,<br>
 but in my circumstances...Matthew Jacobs Ltd pays tax on £40000 = a lot<br>

I don't feel quirky or eccentric today...too much web sorting, quizzing and waking up at 8:15am<br>
<br>
<i>Why did I wake up at 8am?</i><br>
Because Raffi came in my room about then and looked at me...hence waking me up.<br>
Also, I wanted to watch "Just Deal" at 9:30am, but then was sitting at my computer scanning photos...I missed everything today (except Neighbours)<br>
<br>
Raffi pointed out today that the reason Boyd called Declan "Sandy" was because his name is Declan Sands...<br>

<div class="heading"><strong>Insiders</strong> | 21st September 2004</div>
<div class="entry"><img src="http://www.insiders.co.uk/content/40/brit40.gif" align=right style="border:none">
So, when I talk of "Insiders" today, before I forget it all, I refer to the most exciting childrens' film ever.<br>
<br>
The pitch:<br>
When an almost finished, stylish, multi-storey Car Park is knocked down before completion and a single storey, boring building raised in its place, young Matty J marvels at this bizarre occurence.<br>
<br>
Luckily for Matty J, a group calling themselves "Insiders" come to his rescue.<br>
<br>
The Insiders, it is explained, are a group of children who, using the powers of their minds, recreate knocked down buildings and explore them in a different reality.<br>
<br>
In the case of the Car Park, it wasn't actually a car park, it was a Victorian school, and Matty J and the Insiders have to do something (which I can't remember) in the school.<br>
<br>
Eventually it all breaks down into a war scenario with some sort of exciting tunnels and a river splitting the opposing team's bases.<br>
<br>
<i>Reminds me, rather, of <a href="http://www.dayofdefeatmod.com">Day Of Defeat</a> - perhaps I should stop playing it so much</i><br>

<div class="entry"><a href="http://books.dreambook.com/nickbeardo/hansi.html"><img src="http://tmc.spodnet.net/images/flyers/LEO-front-new.jpg" align=right></a>
Whilst I love <a href="http://www.conservativeuk.com/">the Monday Club</a> - the Bishop's Stortford Conservative Club - and <a href="http://www.brambledown.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/mc.htm">the Monday Club</a> - some Bridge Club in Tooting - I mainly love <a href="http://www.djhansi.com/tmc/">The Monday Club</a> - "quality" beats down the Horn in St Albans<br>
<br>
However, every time I go, I sit there, discussing with Tom exactly the same things...<br>
<i>"Isn't Hansi great!"<br>
"I wonder what'll happen next"<br>
"Is that guy actually a sociologist?"</i><br>
<br>
That's my main point.<br>
Every week some rather old guy sits there, with a clipboard, writing stuff...incomprehensible stuff (I read some today..."McKay...")<br>
Is he observing us, studying us...or is he just a freak?<br>
