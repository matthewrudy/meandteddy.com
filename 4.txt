<div class="heading"><strong>When will the Mack thing end?</strong> | 27th September - 1st October</div>

<div class="entry">

<strong>Monday</strong><br>

<img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s10081_txd20040925_v2_f23_188.jpg" align=left>"awww...SUCK!!!" proclaimed Summer. No more truthful words could have been said!<br>
<br>
Summer's antics, lately, have by all means sucked. But so have Mack's. What on earth is she trying to do? <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/images/poses/whos_harold_0061.gif" align=right>Clearly she's just trying to maintain the deception, but for what purpose?<br>
<br>
Why will it ever be good to pretend she's not a cop? Especially if Jack's going to come away thinking she really is a "ratbag" (as Max would surely put it).<br>
<br>
Amongst other things I wish to disrespect today, "this Lyn thing is proper stupid!"<br>
<br>
If she really does love Tom she should make sure Joe dies pretty soon. Then Tom would surely be compelled to do the honest Christian thing and marry her and have babies (lest he be struck down as Onan was for a similar crime).

<strong>Tuesday</strong><br>
I didn't see Neighbours today, what with going back to Cambridge, sorting out my room, seeing Jimmy B...And what?
<hr>
<strong>Wednesday</strong><br>
Well I didn't see it today either. However, today it was no fault of my own. It's because the darn maintenance people have gone and stolen our DVD/video player (which is the only way we get can get TV signal owing to the internal tuner having broken)

<div class="heading"><strong>The Secrets of Sky, Mack and Izzy</strong> | 20th-24th September 2004</div>

<div class="entry">

<strong>Monday</strong><br>

Stingray really knows how to work Sky...I have nothing else to say (given I'm pretending I started writing this yesterday = Monday, when actually I started writing it now = Tuesday)

<strong>Tuesday</strong><br>

<img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s10076_txd20040921_v1_f23_469.jpg" align=left>Today Izzy almost got caught not having Karl's baby.<br>
Although Karl's about to watch a video that'll show him the baby's 12 weeks old - assumedly in Neighbours Time they've been together for less than 12 weeks - either Izzy is going to find a last minute trick to pull him away from the TV, or he'll be stupid and not be able to tell the baby's age correctly<br>
Personally, I must say the latter is the most likely, else it'd shatter our illusions of his professional <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=acuity">acuity</a>.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s9960_txd20040918_v1_f23_129.jpg" align=right>Elsewhere, Lou's Place either has won the Best Beer and Best Pub award, or the woman was lying to them in hope of a few freebies...probably the former.<br>
<br>
Most importantly today was the fact that Declan (who Summer's been trying to dump for ages) was called "Sandy" today by Boyd...twice...perhaps the actor's name is Sandy.<br>
<br>
I hope not, the professionalism of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/whoswho/characterbiogs/index.shtml?content/_boyd/page1">Kyal Marsh</a> has already been put to question

<strong>Wednesday</strong><br>

<img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s10078_txd20040922_v2_f23_555.jpg" align=left>

As expected, Izzy escaped Karl watching the video and ended up destroying the tape. But, what does this mean for the future of The Paternity Secret?<br>
<br>
Clearly, Karl is going to find out, probably through Father Tom showing he's not entirely rubbish. The real question is "how will Karl react?"<img src="images/misc/alanf1.jpg" align=right><br>
<br>
While for us, less upstanding members of Erinsborough society, the treachery may seem too much for any man to stand...we may just sling her out on the street, pointing our fingers and decrying her to be <a href="http://www.genelovesjezebel.com/">"a wife of Ahab"</a>, but we are not <a href="http://www.alanfletcher.net">Karl Kennedy</a><br>
<br>
To him, man of man, moralist of moralist, she is still a woman he has loved, a woman alone in the world, about to have a baby.<br>
<br>
How can he abandon her???<br>
<br>
Obviously, actually, I know that's not going to happen... Darcy's going to come back... she's gonna show herself as being rubbish (beyond lying about the paternity of her unborn child)<br>
<br>
Also, why would Lou ever not hate Trixie? Clearly she was a talentless old lady cynically trying to resurrect her lost career by landing herself the role of short-time famous <a href="http://delta.virtual-obsession.com/index.php?skin=2">Delta Goodrem</a> (to be fair, she might have had a longer career if she hadn't got cancer, but she does look silly in <a href="http://delta.virtual-obsession.com/skins/2/delta.jpg">this photo</a>)

<strong>Thursday</strong><br>

<img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s10079_txd20040923_v2_f23_143.jpg" align=left>

I have no doubt about it...today Summer got what she deserved.<br>
<br>
Ever since she came back from New Guinea she's been poncing about, behaving like a right bitch...even worse than her annoying faux-american friend <a href="http://perfectblend.net/neighbourhood/bio/jeffries-lisa.htm">Lisa Jeffries.</a><br>
<br>
What with Macchiatos...the infamous "shunning of the unicorn"...her assertion that she had "the emotional age of a 15 year old"...<br>
<br>
She was shot down by Lisa and Declan deservingly!!!<br>
<br>
But Susan Kennedy has been behaving unfairly to the kids recently...I reckon she'll get shot down herself when everyone <img src="http://perfectblend.net/neighbourhood/bio/jeffries-lisa.jpg" align=right>finds out about Tom.<br>
<br>
As for the Father Tom, Izzy situation....thrilling as!!!<br>
But, I think Father Tom won't tell anyone - he's a moral man.<br>
<br>
<i>"Izzy’s faked near-miscarriage threatens to blow up in her face."</i>

<strong>Friday</strong><br>

<img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s9958_txd20040916_v1_f23_849.jpg" align=left>

So, yeah, I was blatently right about father Tom<br>
(although the semi-revelation to Susan was a bit strange).<br>
<br>
It was also obvious Izzy wasn't going to get round to tell Karl. It's always the same routine: <br>
<i>emotional potential-confessor sits there, trying to talk, but always blocked by the loving confession-receiver who tries to <img src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/neighbours/news/images/contentimages/img_p154_s10075_txd20040920_v1_f23_55.jpg" align=right>pre-empt the confession with some trivial potentials.</i><br>
<br>
Yes, Dr Karl has allowed the harrowing continuation of this storyline, but you can't blame him.<br>
<br>
Note: I have no views on any other issues dealt with on the show today: The jack thing was same as always, the Sky/Stingray thing was "don't care", so <strong>YEAH</strong><Br><i>(Sky looks really strange in her BBC photos)</i>
