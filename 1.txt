I don't overly like writing about myself.

I guess I'll have to some time soon.

<div class="heading"><strong>Music</strong> | "nah, I don't care no more"</div>

<div class="entry">
There once was a time when Music and I were inseperable.<br>
To be honest, it was largely a lie.<br>
<br>
I spent several years just listening to Oasis, then just to Nirvana, then some mixture of Mogwai and Godspeed You Black Emperor.<br>
<br>
That was a long time ago now.

Yeah, that was good.<br>
Still know it by heart.<br>

<strong>My First Musical Purchase:</strong><br>
My first tape based single was "Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince: Summertime / Boom! Shake the Room", but I didn't buy it, <a href="http://www.bagelz.org">Raffi</a> did.<br>
<br>
The first tape I bought was "Simply Red: Fairground"<br>
Unless it was "Technohead: I want to be a hippy", but that was in the Woolworths bargain bin.<br>
<hr>
Now, I don't really listen to anything, except some Dizzy, Ice Cube, Felix, Daft Punk and Sascha Funke.<br>
<br>
I just don't care any more.
