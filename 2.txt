<div class="entry"><img src="http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/07/23/48m.jpg" align=left>A film about Steve Buscemi, a baby, his bodyguard, and a load of crazy happenings.
Standby for my plot synopsis (and, eventually, the screenplay)

Expect the finished film in time for the Cinecam festival at the start of Easter 2005.</div>

<div class="entry">In case you don't know I spent about 40 hours frustratedly conceiving, writing, filming and editing this collection of 8 video clips. Possibly it ruined my academic career and life. But at least Andy Rendel was happy.</div>

Title: "The Lost Weekend"<br>
Dir: Matthew Rudy Jacobs<br>
Starring: Danny Chan, Neeraj Shah & Alice Brett<br>
<br>
Synopsis:<br>
Danny Chan is a pimp.<br>
Alice is a whore.<br>
Neeraj is a pimp-enforcement-officer (peo).<br>
The film was produced for the 2003 CineCam 48-Hour Guerilla Film-Making Competition.<br>
It was written on the evening of Friday 28th November after I got the title at about 22:39.<br>
The next morning I skipped lectures (Saturday lectures are silly) and got about handing scripts to my reluctant actors.<br>
Basically, it didn't come off too well.<br>
Alice was unenthusiastic, light was going, Neeraj was great, Chan was great, but sound was echo-ey and it got dark.<br>
<br>
Feedback: The official Cinecam verdict was rather patronising (perhaps I deserve it)<br>
<br>
<i>This film has to be praised for its bravery in using substantial dialogue - always a risk with the variability of sound recording. There was a division of opinion concerning the 'controversial' subject matter; reservations were expressed, but so too were plaudits: it was felt by some of us that this added a welcome sense of the bizarre. The acting was largely impressive; with the girl (apologies for not knowing her name) conveying an effective presence and delivering her lines dryly. There were some nice editing touchs, perfectly timed with the dialogue and its sense of ominous melodrama. The connection to the title was seen as somewhat token. Sound was at times a limitation (even after the projection problem was solved), but there have been worse student films in this regard in the past. Likewise, rather unsteady camera work was noticeable in points, particularly during the opening walk down Trinity St. Overall, again a worthwhile - if occasionally flawed - effort, and promising in many areas of film-making.</i></div>

Do Not Obstruct

<div class="entry">
<img src="images/films/donotobstruct1.jpg" align=left></a><strong>"The Film That Defined A Generation"</strong> said noone.<br>
However, people did come and see it, prompted by emails heralding the arrival of something great.<br>
<br>
Envisioned by myself as some silly guerilla fim-making, it turned into something much stranger, something much more pretentious.<br>
<br>
Clicky, glitchy beeps and surprisingly well edited footage define this collaboration between myself (direction, camera, editing), Julian David Parker (sound and "acting") and Alice Brett (the woman)<br>
<br>
Yeah, it was good...at least it was the first time I watched it, then it stopped being scary.<br>
<br>
And the montage of "I'm not taking the piss" really was a meaningful addition (very similar to Scott/Stingray's "BYO Meaning!")<br>
Try it yourself!!!

This really wasn't planned.<br>
I'd just got back to Cambridge, with my new camera, saw an opportunity to shoot a demonstration, I did so...<br>
<br>
ended up with good footage and a front page spot on Varsity (which I always seem to forget about)<br>
<br>
Sadly, at the time I was trying to be modest, and threw away my Varsity cover story...I'm such a bum!
